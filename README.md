## 🃏 About Catch Eleven

On my return trip from **Berlin**, late at night on the train, I decided to start developing **Catch Eleven**, a classic Persian card game.  
I wanted to spend my time on something **useful, educational, and fun** — and maybe make the journey feel a little shorter.  

During that trip, I built the **fundamental structure** of the program, and I’ll continue improving it in the future.  
For now, it’s **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**! 🚧😄
