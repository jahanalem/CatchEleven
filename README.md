## 🃏 About Catch Eleven

On my return trip from **Berlin**, late at night on the train, I decided to start developing **Catch Eleven**, a classic Persian card game.  
I wanted to spend my time on something **useful, educational, and fun** — and maybe make the journey feel a little shorter.  

During that trip, I built the **fundamental structure** of the program, and I’ll continue improving it in the future.  
For now, it’s **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**! 🚧😄


## 🃏 Game Rules — Catch Eleven

**Catch Eleven** is a modern digital version of the traditional Persian card game *Pasoor (also called "Yazdeh")*.  
The goal is to collect cards from the table by making combinations that add up to **11** or by using special face-card rules.

---

### 🎯 Goal of the Game
Players try to **capture cards** from the table to earn points.  
You can take cards when:
- The **sum of card values equals 11**, or  
- You play a **King, Queen, or Jack** that matches the special rules below.

At the end of each round, players count their captured cards and score points.  
The first player (or team) to reach the target score wins.

---

### 👥 Number of Players
- Usually **2 players**.  
- Can also be played with **4 players (two teams)**.  
- Teammates sit opposite each other.

---

### 🎴 Cards
- The game uses a **standard 52-card deck** (no Jokers).
- Card values are:

| Card | Value for sum-to-11 | Rule / Notes |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|
| A (Ace) | 1 | Used only to make 11 |
| 2–10 | Face value | Normal numbers for combinations |
| J (Jack) | — | Takes **all** cards from the table |
| Q (Queen) | — | Takes **only** another Queen |
| K (King) | — | Takes **only** another King |

---

### 🔄 Dealing the Cards
1. Shuffle the deck well.  
2. Deal **4 cards to each player**.  
3. Place **4 cards face-up on the table**.  
4. Keep the rest of the deck aside — new hands will be dealt later.  
5. The starting player can be chosen randomly (or the winner of the previous round starts next).

---

### 🎮 How to Play
Players take turns, one card per turn:

1. On your turn, **play one card** from your hand.  
2. If that card can **capture** any cards from the table, take them and keep them face-down in your pile.  
3. If it cannot capture anything, **place it on the table** face-up.  
4. Continue until everyone’s hand is empty.  
5. Then deal the next 4 cards to each player (no new cards on the table).  
6. Repeat until the whole deck (52 cards) has been played.

### ⚙️ Capturing Rules

#### 1️⃣ Normal Rule — Make 11
If the total value of your played card and one or more table cards equals **11**,  
you can take those cards.

**Examples:**
- Table has 9♦ → you play 2♣ → total = 11 ✅  
- Table has 8♠ + 3♥ → you play nothing else → total = 11 ✅  
- Table has 7♦ + 5♣ → too high ❌  
- Face cards (J, Q, K) never count in the 11-sum rule.

---

#### 👑 Special Cards
- **King (K):** Takes **only** another King.  
- **Queen (Q):** Takes **only** another Queen.  
- **Jack (J):** Takes **all** cards from the table.  
  - If the table is empty, the Jack does nothing.  
- **Ace (A):** Counts as **1** when making 11.

---

### 💥 Special Bonus — Basaat (Clear Table)
If you clear **all cards** from the table in one move  
(and not by using a Jack),  
you earn **+10 bonus point** called *Basaat*.

---

### 🧮 Scoring at the End of Each Round

When all 52 cards are played, count each player’s captured cards.

| Category | Condition | Points |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| 🃏 **Most Cards** | Player with the most captured cards | +3 |
| 💎 **Most Diamonds (♦)** | Player with the most ♦ cards | +1 |
| ♦️ **Two of Diamonds (2♦)** | Always worth | +2 |
| 🤴 **Jack of Diamonds (J♦)** | Always worth | +1 |
| 🌟 **Basaat (Clear Table)** | Clearing the table (not with Jack) | +10 |

> ⚠️ If two players tie in total cards or Diamonds,  
> nobody gets that bonus.

---

### 🏆 Winning the Game
- **2-Player Mode:** First to reach **62 points** wins.  
- **Team Mode (4 players):** First team to reach **120 points** wins.

---

### 🧠 Strategy Tips
- Remember which cards have already been played or captured.  
- Save your **Jack (J)** for when the table has many cards.  
- Try to collect **Diamonds (♦)** — they give extra points.  
- If you can clear the table without a Jack, do it — it’s worth a *Basaat* bonus.  
- Always watch what your opponent captures; this helps you guess their hand.
